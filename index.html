                We're a small team of computer science majors interested in helping
                others by offering fun, accessible experiences that encourage people
                like you to live active, healthy lifestyles. This website is our
                latest project, brought to you through the MHacks hackathon at the
                University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. We hope you enjoy Push-Up
                Ninja, and look forward to growing with you.

                This website requires the Myo armband, a wearable gadget that reads
                electrical impulses from the muscles of the forearm and transmits
                them via bluetooth to our software. All you need to do is:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Fit the armband onto the thickest part of your right arm (even
                    if you're left handed) with the micro-usb port facing away from you.
                    Make sure the glowing blue Myo logo is facing up and slightly to
                    the right.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let your arm hang by your side, then raise your forearm and wave
                    your hand outward and to the right. If the band vibrates and the
                    blue light starts flashing quickly, you've just successfully synced
                    the device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigate down to the Start button at the bottom of this
                    page. Make sure you're ready, and then assume a
                    straight-armed planking position. When the indicator on
                    the screen tells you to start, begin your
                    Push-Ups. Remember to keep a steady pace and not to
                    over-exert yourself -- your health is important to us!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Come back whenever you want to beat your high score! It'll
                    be right here waiting for you.
                </li>
